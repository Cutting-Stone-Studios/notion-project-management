# Background:

In moments to Midnight, you play as an everyday individual with 7-days left until Doomsday. The game is narrative focused, meaning that depending on the decisions and conversations you have with characters you encounter, you will have a different and unique ending. 

## Basics

- Timeline
    
    Doomsday is in 7 days
    
- Your Character and Play
    - Everyday player character wakes up talks to people.
    - Character will encounter crossroads for accessing different areas of the game.
    - Different Areas have different NPCs, talking to them differently can lead to different endings.
- Endings
    - No matter what, the game will end in 7-days. There are no endings that result in the world not ending.
    - Talking to different NPCs, accessing different areas, making different decisions leads to slightly different endings.
- Play Dynamics and Impact to Endings
    - You can just talk to the people in your home and neighborhood, get an ending where you are with your loved ones as you see the world get destroyed.
    - You can take negative dialogue options, grow bitter and get an ending where you die alone
    - You can talk to holy and demonic beings to understand more about what is going on, you can help homeless people have a nice last week at least.
    - Lots of stories to discover, ranging from dark and depressing to wholesome and uplifting, or ones that just make you confused.
